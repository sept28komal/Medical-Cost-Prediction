# Medical-Cost-Prediction
About the Dataset - The Medical Cost Prediction consists of around 1300 records and six independent variables along with charges target variable:

Age - The age of the individual, which can influence health risks and insurance charges.
Sex - The gender of the individual (Male or Female). This may be used to analyze how health insurance charges differ by gender.
BMI (Body Mass Index) - A measure of body fat based on height and weight. It helps assess an individualâ€™s overall health and risk of certain diseases, which can impact insurance costs.

Children - The number of children/dependents the individual has. This can be relevant for insurance plans that cover family members and influence the total charges.

Smoker - Whether the individual smokes (Yes or No). Smoking can lead to higher health risks, which is reflected in higher insurance premiums.

Region - The geographical location of the individual (e.g., northeast, southwest, etc.). This may affect the cost of health insurance depending on local healthcare costs and policies.

Charges - The medical charges billed to the individual by the insurance company. These are influenced by factors such as age, smoking status, BMI, and region, and are the dependent variable of interest in insurance models.

Here we need to predict the medical costs of individuals based on different features using several ML(regression) algorithms
